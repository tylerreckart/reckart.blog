One might look at the interconnectedness of trade, commerce, and travel in the modern age and conclude that a lot of how our world operates is unique to our era. Ocean-spanning shipping lanes, rail networks, and highways allow the goods we consume and the product of our labors to travel the world without much thought on the part of the end consumer. While the methods themselves, especially air travel, are unique to the modern world, the highly-connected nature of today is far from unique. This post is a story about a similarly interconnected society long ago and factors that coalesced to bring it all crashing down.

As a student of history and someone whose career has been built on the technology of today, the story of the bronze age collapse is one that I have been fascinated with for many years. In order to understand the collapse, we have to travel back to the end of the 12th century BCE and take a look at the societies that rose and fell, and ultimately paved the way for the world we inhabit today.
