I'm a software engineer who's spent the last ten years building systems that work—both technically and for the people using them.

I've led teams, architected platforms, and worked across every layer of the stack. Fintech, SaaS, creative tools—the domain changes, but the challenge stays the same: make something complex feel simple, make something powerful feel accessible.

I'm a builder by nature. When I'm not writing code, I'm making music, shooting film, or taking apart something to see how it works.

This is where I share what I'm learning and making. If you're working on something interesting or just want to chat, reach out.
