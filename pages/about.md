I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/tylerreckart), watch geek, and cyclist based in Greenville, SC. Currently I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at [ActiveCampaign](https://activecampaign.com). In my previous role, I worked as a Senior Software Developer at [Alley](https://alley.co), where I focused on contributing to the [Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving) open-source headless CMS framework for WordPress, developing training materials for junior developers, and crafting custom headless WordPress experiences for publishers and brands like the [MIT Technology Review](https://technologyreview.com) and [Defector](https://defector.com). Additionally, I've worked as a Software Engineer at [BoomTown](https://boomtownroi.com), [TipHive](https://friyay.io), and [Authentic Form & Function](https://authenticff.com). Outside of work, I've authored a training course on GraphQL with Manning Publications called [GraphQL in Motion](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/graphql-in-motion) and ride my bike [a lot](https://www.strava.com/athletes/148363).
