I'm a [software engineer, builder, and perpetual tinkerer](https://tylers.world/). Over the past decade, I’ve worked across the full stack, from front-end interfaces to deeply integrated backend systems, leading teams and architecting scalable solutions. My experience spans fintech, SaaS, and creative technology, with a focus on designing efficient, high-performance systems that balance usability with technical depth.

This site is where I share ideas, projects, and thoughts on engineering, technology, and the creative process. If any of that resonates with you, I’d love to connect.

My full CV is available on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tylerreckart).
