I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/tylerreckart), watch geek, and cyclist based in Greenville, SC. Currently I'm a Senior Software Developer at [Alley](https://alley.co), where I focus on contributing to the [Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving) open-source headless CMS framework for WordPress, developing training materials for junior developers, and crafting custom headless WordPress experiences for publishers and brands. Previously I've worked as a Software Engineer at [BoomTown](https://boomtownroi.com), a Front-End Engineer at [TipHive](https://friyay.io), and as a UI Engineer at [Authentic Form & Function](https://authenticff.com). Outside of work, I've authored a training course on GraphQL with Manning Publications called [GraphQL in Motion](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/graphql-in-motion) and ride my bike [a lot](https://www.strava.com/athletes/148363).
