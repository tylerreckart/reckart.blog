I'm a [software developer](https://github.com/tylerreckart) based in Greenville, South Carolina. Currently I'm a Senior Front-End Engineer at [ActiveCampaign](https://activecampaign.com) where I lead a team of engineers focused on building scalable performance solutions for our customers. In my previous role I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Alley](https://alley.co) where I was responsible for working across the software stack to contribute to the company's open-source initiatives like the [Irving](https://github.com/alleyinteractive/irving) headless React framework for WordPress and develop custom subscription access model integrations for brands like [Defector](https://defector.com) and the [MIT Technology Review](https://technologyreview.com). Additionally, I've worked as a Front-End Engineer at [BoomTown](https://boomtownroi.com), [TipHive](https://friyay.io), and [Authentic Form & Function](https://authenticff.com).

In 2019, I published [GraphQL in Motion](https://manning.com/livevideo/graphql-in-motion) with [Manning Publications](https://manning.com). The course consists of over two an a half hours of content and 28 exercises that teaches the fundamentals of building GraphQL APIs in Node.js. Following a series of examples, viewers learn to use the GraphQL syntax to write simple data-retrieval queries, design complex schemas, and tackle more advanced challenges like direct data manipulation, live subscriptions, and error handling.

Outside of work I'm a father, an [avid cyclist](https://www.strava.com/athletes/148363), and [photographer](https://instagram.com/tylerreckart).

The source code for this website is available on [Github](https://github.com/tylerreckart/reckart.blog). When I launched this version of my website, I [wrote](/blog/starting-over) about the build system I developed that handles rendering all of the content, markup, and styling. The configuration has changed a little since then, but the core idea behind the markdown-based templating system is still at the foundation of this website's architecture.
