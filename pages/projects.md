A selection of things I've built. Some are products, some are tools, some are experiments that stuck around longer than expected.

## [Albums](https://albums.fm)
The music app. For people who refuse to let streaming companies own their taste. Catalog your physical collection, integrate with streaming services, play local files—treat your library like the curated archive it is, not a rented playlist.

## Active Open Source

Maintained libraries and tools I use in my own work.

### [HappyPath](https://github.com/tylerreckart/HappyPath)
Stop annoying users with review prompts after three app launches. This Swift package evaluates actual engagement—usage patterns, meaningful actions, session duration—to ask for reviews when people are most likely to give them. Respects users, improves ratings.

### [Hyperzsh](https://github.com/tylerreckart/hyperzsh)
Minimal zsh prompt built for git workflows. Shows what you need, hides what you don't. Fast, clean, opinionated.

## Archived Projects

Apps I shipped, maintained, and eventually open-sourced. Each one had real users and solved a specific problem until the market or my priorities shifted.

### [Factor](https://github.com/tylerreckart/Factor)
Exposure calculator for film photographers. Built for shooters who need reciprocity corrections, filter factor adjustments, and bellows calculations in the field—not in post. The technical math, automated.

### [Spindown](https://github.com/tylerreckart/Spindown)
Game tracker for Magic: The Gathering. Handles 2-6 players, poison counters, energy, experience—everything pen and paper does, without the smudges.
